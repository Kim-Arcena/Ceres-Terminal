  <p>You are a lone spaceman, whose origins are from what is now a fragmented Earth, wandering the vast universe in search of parts to maintain and possibly upgrade your debilitating ship by shooting down space debris just like in Asteroids. As you travel across galaxies, your mind begins to wonder, is there any point in continuing this journey?

  <br>Different levels will be set in different settings with their own music theme, such as an asteroid belt or a rogue planet. The game starts off as black and white but as you progress, colors start to appear and become more vibrant for each succeeding level. Each level also has its own unique mechanic to add unique difficulty and experience for the player. 
  
  <be> The goal of our game is to add a sentimental and moving story through the use of graphics and music in a simple game that is Asteroids.
  </p>

  <h3>Overview:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>This game is developed using Unity 3d.</li>
    <li>When the player dies,  the game will automatically restart the current level. The game's state is reset to the beginning of the level, so the player can try again without losing their overall progress. The game repeats the level until the win condition is achieved. </li>
    <li>Every level has a varying number of seconds to survive a level. Consequently, additional obstacles are also spawned per level, as well as the number of asteroids that the player needs to destroy  Upon reaching the final level. There are 4 levels (Scenes) for the game excluding the tutorial level where the user gets familiarized with various keys to the game's overall gameplay. As the level progresses the game, so does the difficulty for each level. </li>
    <li>The game presents a series of obstacles. The goal is to either destroy these obstacles or avoid them entirely. To destroy the obstacles, the player must shoot the obstacles. To dodge, the player has to maneuver the vehicle skillfully to avoid contact with them.  Successfully destroying or dodging all the obstacles within the given timeframe will be rewarded with progression to the next level.</li>
    <li>The player gains points whenever they destroy an asteroid. There are different types/sizes of asteroids and the player can gain different amounts of points depending on the size/type of asteroid they destroy. Harder-to-hit asteroids such as small and fast asteroids will score more points for the player when hit.</li>
  </ul>
